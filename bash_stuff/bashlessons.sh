# grep is a regex parser

cat file | grep <REGEX PATTERN>
grep <REGEX PATTERN> file

# Common Options:
- c   : count number of occurrences
- m # : repeat match # times
- R   : recursively through directories
- o   : only print matching part of line
- n   : print the line number
- v   : invert match, print non-matching lines


# sed is a stream editor (i.e. find and replace)
cat file | sed <COMMAND> file
sed <COMMAND> file

# Common uses:
4d 					- delete line 4
2,4d 				- delete lines 2-4
2w foo				- write line 2 to file foo
/here/d 			- delete line matching here
/here/,/there/d 	- delete lines matching here to there
s/PATTERN/text/		- switch text matching PATTERN
/PATTERN/a\text		- append line with text after matching PATTERN
/PATTERN/c\text		- change line with text for matching PATTERN

# awk is a script language that turns text into records and fields
# that you can access as ad hoc database. can manipulate the records 
# or fields before they're displayed

cat file | awk <COMMAND>
awk <COMMAND> file

# Fields are separated by white space or by regex FS
# The fields are denoted $1, $2, ..., while $0 refers to the entire line.
# If FS is null, the input line is plit into one field per character.

# Records are separated by \n (new line), or by regex RS

- NF	# number of fields in the current record
- NR 	# ordinal number of the current record
- FS 	# regular expression used to separate fields; also settable by option -Ffs (default whitespace)
- RS 	# input record separator (default newline)
- OFS 	# output field separator (default blank)
- ORS	# output record separator (default newline)
